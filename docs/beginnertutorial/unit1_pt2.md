Now that we have enclosed your Raspberry Pi in it's protective case, let's begin by plugging in the mouse and keybaord. Your kit includes a keyboard and mouse, but I should point out that any USB mouse and keyboard will work just fine in the event you misplace or damage these keyboards. Also included with the keyboard is a red micro USB to USB cable <!-- picture needed -->. 
#### Connect the keyboard 
   1. First, plug the micro USB connector into the micro USB port on the keyboard. You'll notice some extra USB ports, but the one you're concerned with is the smallest one in the center. 
  2. Plug the standard USB connector into one of the **black** USB ports on the Raspberry Pi. 

####   What's the difference between the blue and black USB ports? 
   The main difference between the two USB port types is **speed**. Black USB ports are USB 2.0 ports, while blue USB ports are USB 3.0. As you can probably already infer, USB 3.0 provides faster speeds than USB 2.0. You could use the blue ports for the keyboard and mouse if you wanted, but it's not necessary that our input devies have blazingly fast speeds. A better usage for USB 3.0 ports would be transferring large amounts of data. One popular use for the Raspberry Pi using it as a home server device for storing large media files such as videos, pictures or games. Since these files are large in nature, transfering them to an external hard drive will help save space on your Pi. Plugging your external hard drive into the USB 3.0 port would transfer those large media files in a much shorter time frame.
