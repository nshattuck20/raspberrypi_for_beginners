This section will cover the following topics: 
* What is a Raspberry Pi, anways? 
* Different Raspberry Pi models
* Your Raspberry Pi Kit 
* Understanding your Pi 
* Assembling your Pi

### What is a Raspberry Pi, anyways? 
<!-- Need an embedded image -->

Cost is one of the largest barriers preventing schools districts, families, and students from having access to computing cirriculum. The Raspberry Pi was built in response to combat this barrier to provide students with an easily accessable and affordable option. The Raspberry Pi is a single board computer roughly the size of a credit card. It's a popular tool among educators, hobbyists, and professionals for learning the basics of computer science. 

Also worth noting is their cute and huggable appearance. I imagine hugging them would be similar to hugging a hedgehog in that they are prickly, modular, and their small size is rather huggable isn't it? It's small size also enables students to easily transport them between different locations and projects. They are computers in every sense despite their size. The latest model, the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B, touts the 
following specs: 

Model     | RAM  | GHz (Processor) 
--------- | ---- | -----
Raspberry Pi 4 Model B | 2GB, 4GB or 8GB LPDDR4-3200 SDRAM (depending on model) | Broadcom BCM2711, Quad core Cortex-A72 (ARM v8) 64-bit SoC @ 1.5GHz

Don't worry if you don't know what any of this means. The important thing to take away from this introduction is that the Raspberry Pi offers a very powerful set 
of tools to beginners and professionals alike! 


### Different Raspberry Pi Models 

The Raspberry Pi comes in various models capable of accomplishing a variety of different objectives. I won't go into detail about all of them (there are alot) 
but here are a few of them just to give you an idea: 
* #### Rasbperry Pi 4 Model B 
  <!-- Just need a link to a raspberrypi.org for each model?  --> 
    This is the model that comes bundled with your Canakit Raspberry Pi Kit. You can think of it as the "Jack of all trades" model, in that it is capable 
  of handling all sorts of tasks. You can game on them, build weather stations, use the GPIO pins to communicate with other hardware, and loads more. What seperates 
  the Model 4 from legacy models are more modern features such as Bluetooth, higher RAM capacities, and faster processors. 
* #### Raspberry Pi 3 Model B 
    This model is an earlier build of the Model 4 B. Usually these older models are used for more legacy projects. By legacy, I mean older. Sometimes there are 
  projects that require hardware or code libraries which may not be maintained on the Model 4. However, there are still many users who prefer the older 
  Model 3 because of personal reasons as well! 
* #### Raspberry Pi Zero 
    The smallest and cheapest model. You'll notice that the Zero is stripped of all of the hardware components of the Model 3 and Model 4. Don't let it's 
    minimal appearance fool you! 

As you can see, the Raspberry Pi comes in various builds that are each catered to a diverse array of projects. Once you become familiar with your Raspberry Pi, 
learning how to work with a different model is merely a matter of applying what you've already learned! Now that we've covered the different Raspberry Pi models, let's talk about your Canakit Raspberry Pi bundle. 

### Your Raspberry Pi Kit 
<!-- I will need pictures of my own set up for this section that I will add at a later time. --> 
It's time to unbox your Raspberry Pi! (I know, you probably unboxed it and skipped the previous sections).  Your kit comes bundled with quite a few gadgets that you might be familiar with, and others will be completely alien to you. Don't worry, we won't be using everything in this course. The hardware you will 
need for now are the: 
1. Raspberry Pi computer board  
2. Keyboard and mouse
3. White/Black Raspberry Pi case 
4. Micro HDMI to HDMI cable and power adapter 
5. 3 aluminium heat sinks 
6. Black cooling fan 
7. Miro SD card (this contains your operating system!) 
8. Extension power switch (optional) 

**We will not be using the camera in this course** , so you can put that aside for now. We will eventually be plugging your computer into the monitor as well, but for now let's focus soley on the Pi. In fact, let's only focus on the Raspberry Pi board itself. It's important to have some basic understanding of the layout of the board before we start plugging everything in. Furthermore, it allows us to get the best performance out of our Pi so that we don't use uneccessary resources. 

### Understanding your Pi 

While your kit does come with a instruction manual (which is really helpful I might add), I find that seeing an image of a used Pi with parts attached provides a better of sense of where parts attach. The image below is a picture of my own Raspberry Pi with the heat sinks already attached. You'll know that it's mine because my heat sinks are a bit crooked (I tape to the beat of my own drumb, okay?). My magnificent taping abilities aside, I think this will be helpful in demonstrating where you will eventually attach them. There's quite a bit going on here but I have broken down the components of the Pi to only the areas we will be working with.
