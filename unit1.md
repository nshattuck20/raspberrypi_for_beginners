# UNIT 1: Build Your First Computer with The Raspberry Pi! 

This section will cover the following topics: 
* What is a Raspberry Pi, anways? 
* Different Raspberry Pi models
* Your Raspberry Pi Kit 
* Understanding your Pi 
* Assembling your Pi  
<!-- more to come --> 

### What is a Raspberry Pi, anyways? 
<!-- Need an embedded image --> 
One of the largest barriers preventing more students from learning about computing is the cost of technology. The Raspberry Pi was built in response to 
combat this barrier in hopes that more students around the world could have more access to the world of computer science. The Raspberry Pi is a single board 
computer roughly the size of a credit card and a popular tool among educators, hobbyists, and professionals for learning the basics of computer science. 
They are cute and huggable (in a sort of modular, pokey sort of huggy) and their small size enables students to easily transport 
them between different locations and projects. They are computers in every sense despite their size. The latest model, the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B, touts the 
following specs: 

Model     | RAM  | GHz (Processor) 
--------- | ---- | -----
Raspberry Pi 4 Model B | 2GB, 4GB or 8GB LPDDR4-3200 SDRAM (depending on model) | Broadcom BCM2711, Quad core Cortex-A72 (ARM v8) 64-bit SoC @ 1.5GHz

Don't worry if you don't know what any of this means. The important thing to take away from this introduction is that the Raspberry Pi offers a very powerful set 
of tools to beginners and professionals alike! 


### Different Raspberry Pi Models 

The Raspberry Pi comes in various models capable of accomplishing a variety of different objectives. I won't go into detail about all of them (there are alot) 
but here are a few of them just to give you an idea: 
* #### Rasbperry Pi 4 Model B 
  <!-- Need images of each model --> 
    This is the model that comes bundled with your Canakit Raspberry Pi Kit. You can think of it as the "Jack of all trades" model, in that it is capable 
  of handling all sorts of tasks. You can game on them, build weather stations, use the GPIO pins to communicate with other hardware, and loads more. What seperates 
  the Model 4 from legacy models are more modern features such as Bluetooth, higher RAM capacities, and faster processors. 
* #### Raspberry Pi 3 Model B 
    This model is an earlier build of the Model 4 B. Usually these older models are used for more legacy projects. By legacy, I mean older. Sometimes there are 
  projects that require hardware or code libraries which may not be maintained on the Model 4. However, there are still many users who prefer the older 
  Model 3 because of personal reasons as well! 
* #### Raspberry Pi Zero 
    The smallest and cheapest model. You'll notice that the Zero is stripped of all of the hardware components of the Model 3 and Model 4. Don't let it's 
    minimal appearance fool you!
